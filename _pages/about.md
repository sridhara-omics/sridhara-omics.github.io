I am a bioinformatics scientist with expertise in computational immunology, oncology, and data engineering. My background includes molecular dynamics, NGS analysis, and mass-spec data processing. I have over a decade of experience in research and bioinformatics, working on diverse projects and mentoring graduate students. Passionate about building robust pipelines, I specialize in tools like Igblast, immcantation, and Seurat. I enjoy developing scalable solutions for complex biological data. Currently exploring new opportunities in bioinformatics leadership roles.
