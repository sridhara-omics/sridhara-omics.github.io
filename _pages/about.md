I am a bioinformatics scientist with lot of experience in building bioinformatics pipelines for both Next Generation Sequencing based transcriptomics/genomics data and mass-spectrometry based proteomics data. My recent focus was in computational immunology especially analyzing NGS and mass-spec data of antibodies.

My PHD in Electrical and Computer Engineering, with bioinformatics dissertation and my interest in high-performance computing (right from graduate studies) drove me to pursue this career. 

I published more than 20 articles, including Nature Biomedical Engineering, PLoS Computational Biology, with h-index 15, and 1000+ citations. My favorite programming languages are Python and R, and in my free time, I like to play chess, and know a bit more about spirituality!
